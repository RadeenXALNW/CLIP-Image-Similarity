***CLIP BASED IMAGE SEARCH***

### Clip Image similarity is an unqiue approach to find similar image given a particular image. Here there will be two type of dataset. One is query dataset and other one is candidate set. We will take a image from query dataset and find if similar image is in the candidate dataset. 

### A pretrained model is being used for compute the embeddings. This model is trained on the specific task. So that we can get better embedding vector.

An example is given below:
