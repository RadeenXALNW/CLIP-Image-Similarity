# CLIP BASED IMAGE SEARCH 

**Clip Image similarity is an unqiue approach to find similar image given a particular image. Here there will be two type of dataset. One is query dataset and other one is candidate set. We will take a image from query dataset and find if similar image is in the candidate dataset.**
**These embeddings serve as compact, high-dimensional representations of the images, allowing for efficient and accurate comparisons. By selecting an image from the query dataset and generating its embedding, the system can then search for similar images within the candidate dataset by comparing their embeddings.**
